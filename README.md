# Freshman Roulette
## ECS102 Final Project
## by Justin Gluska

**Play Roulette by downloading and running 'roulette.py', enter a username and automatically start with a certain amount of money. The game saves the name of each player with the remaining money so try not to lose!**

## **Features**
* Random wheel rotation
* Customized betting
* Individual player stats
* Spin tracking
* And more!

## **Bugs**
* Report in the issues tracker, will fix any found!

## **Will Not Fix**
* You can only bet on 1 option currently (key list is displayed in-game). I do not plan on adding support to bet on multiple options at once (like $5 on '1' and $10 on '3').
